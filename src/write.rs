/**
	Only necessary for custom (de-)serializations.

	Interface for writing data with a specified endianness. Use this interface to make serializations automatically switch endianness without having to write the same code twice.

	In theory this would be the only write trait and BE-/LEWrite would be aliases to the BE/LE type parameter variants, but for some reason that doesn't import methods in `use` notation.

	## Examples

	```
	use endio::LEWrite;

	let mut writer = vec![];
	writer.write(42u8);
	writer.write(true);
	writer.write(754187983u32);

	assert_eq!(writer, b"\x2a\x01\xcf\xfe\xf3\x2c");
	```
